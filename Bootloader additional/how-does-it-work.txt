The python script (HexLoader) takes Intel HEX files and transmits to the bootloader via I2C (Arduino module).

Intel HEX format and difference between it and microchip hex format: bootloader_guide.pdf 19/45
Program flash memory structure: PIC16F18345 data sheet 123/491

A row consists of 32 words
One word consists of 14 bits -> max value: 0x3fff
Little-endian system: in a word, first byte is LSByte, second is MSByte
MPLAB X export hex file produces a little-endian hex file, which probably needs no further adjustments!

Saving (in .C file) a variable to a given address means a word address; in the hex file, this is converted into a byte address.
